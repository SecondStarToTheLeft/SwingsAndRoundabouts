FIXME tidy up the intro comments on this and other pages

- imports defined objects and functions the other files.
- changeable parameters of the model
    TODO consider moving parameters to pendulum.py incase we want to loop over a set,
        but keep parameters that we are looping over

When it outputs in the IDE (not saved, just shown) :
- animation of the pendulum position over time
- analysis data / plots:
    - GPE vs KE over time
    - speed of pump vs time to reach top
    -

    TODO figure out what the analysis for this needs to be

TODO ask lecturer if we are marked on any code things ( i.e  legibility / testing etc)
TODO ask about use of AI for refactoring etc, or is this an absolute ban
